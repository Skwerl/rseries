Arduino Controller &amp; Receiver for R2-D2

Note that there are multiple branches for this repository. I'm currently working on an experimental new controller based on a custom shield I designed for the Arduino Fio. See the **traditional** branch for code for the "standard" R-Series controller/receiver hardware by Michael Erwin & Co. My current work (master branch) uses a custom controller with the Erwin receiver.
